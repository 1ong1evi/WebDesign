        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching consequences, and one of the sectors significantly impacted was the information industry. In 2020, approximately 17.75 million Americans found themselves unemployed, and within specific sectors like newsrooms, employment witnessed a notable decline (Pew Research).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>The decline in newsroom employment during the pandemic is a critical issue with broader societal implications. According to Pew Research, newsroom employment has fallen by 26% since 2008, with a third of large U.S. newspapers experiencing layoffs in 2020. This background sets the stage for understanding the gravity of the problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>To gain deeper insights into this issue, my project utilized data analysis and visualizations with a focus on 2020-2021. The primary objective was to explore employment trends within the information sector, leveraging US Census data. This involved using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, requests, seaborn, as well as Datawrapper for visualization, and Git for version control.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Mentorship</h1>
        <p>I collaborated with Professor Dr. Carter, co-director of Texas Community Health News, who provided valuable mentorship. Dr. Carter guided my analysis, helping me conceptualize the project to produce meaningful results.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>How I Acquired the Data</h1>
        <p>To create a comprehensive dataset, I looped through US Census APIs, compiling and cleaning data. This resulted in a master data frame containing location, CSA, and employment data for the years 2017-2021.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Questions to Ask</h1>
        <p>The project aimed to answer crucial questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What years had the lowest employment numbers? (Visualized for clarity)</li>
            <li>Which CSAs had the highest employment numbers? (Visualized using Datawrapper)</li>
            <li>What were the top 20 locations with the highest employment changes? (Visualized or presented in a table)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>The detailed analysis uncovered significant insights, yet to be categorized as results.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Reproduce Work</h1>
        <p>For transparency and reproducibility, the data was exported into a CSV file named 'Cen_17_21.csv', capturing all information from 2017 to 2021.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>This project not only sheds light on the employment trends within the information sector during the pandemic but also demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and collaboration with mentors.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Visuals</h1>
        <p>Throughout the portfolio, visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables are incorporated to enhance understanding and engagement.</p>
