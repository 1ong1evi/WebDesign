    <p>When it comes to my free time, I have a good amount of options to choose from.  I only recently got big into reading about two years ago. The first book of this little journey was "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell. It is somewhat in the self-help area, but I heard him on a few podcasts and only recently knew I read some of his articles. It was a great book to start my enjoyment of reading. </p>
    <p>When I'm not trying to mentally grow, I also wish to grow physically. However,  I believe you can work on both mental and physical aspects with walking. When I take a walk I try to get rid of distractions like phones, music, or even watches. Then I go on a short walk, it has helped me tremendously and I only bring it up because I hope you would try the same. Along with walking, I work out also but nothing crazy just enough to be consistent with it. </p>
    <p>I have always had an appreciation for nature, but I think I'm growing my green thumb a bit. I have been taking care of my parents and grandparents' garden for a while now. They have beautiful flowers and a lushes garden. With the Texas heat, you are limited to what you can grow. However, we do a couple of different types of peppers, cabbage, kale, broccoli, and all types of herbs, and now and then try to do strawberries. It is very satisfying to see a return in food for how much effort you put into it all. The plant in the picture is the only plant I have indoors which is a money tree. </p>
