    <p>Hi, I'm Levi Long, a Junior at Texas State majoring in digital media innovations in the Mass Communications department. I work at H-E-B as a produce stocker, but I have also worked in central checkout, dairy, and grocery. Produce has treated me the best out of all four departments. In my early to late teens before H-E-B I worked on my family's ranch. I will take doing labor in the A/C any day compared to our hot summers. </p>
    <p>I am from Bastrop, Texas home to the "Lost Pines." The reason being is due to us having over 75,00 acres that consist of loblolly pines. You might have heard of us in 2011 due to the Bastrop County Complex Fire with 34,356 acres burnt. However, I grew up on a cattle ranch that's still in operation today. So I would say I have an appreciation for both the indoors and outdoors. In about 14 years the ranch will be able to be entered into ranches over 100 years old. </p>
    <p>I usually read, walk, work out, play video games, or mess with my plants. About a year ago I recently got big into programming in hopes of breaking into tech. However, this past summer I took a whole month off so I'm trying to find the motivation to get back into it. I recently bought this book called "Cracking the Coding Interview" so I'm hoping it gives me the push I need.  If you want to talk about anything wildlife or nature I'm your guy. Now don't be surprised if I also talk your ear off about programming stuff such as data structures or algorithms. </p>
