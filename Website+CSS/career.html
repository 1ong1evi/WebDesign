    <p>About nine months before COVID-19 I started my journey at H-E-B by learning the ins and outs of a Cashier. When the pandemic rolled around my store gave me the option of a raise to work in the grocery department. I took the offer because of the pay but mostly for the experience to see how a store operates. After doing so they saw how good I was they cross-trained me in the dairy department shortly after. Fast forward a year later I wanted to learn another department. I ended up learning in the produce department where I have been for over a year now. </p>
    <p>From what I learned at H-E-B I could never have learned anywhere else. Learning a new job through a pandemic gives you an understanding of uncertainty along with getting to know the job itself. Being able to operate in this climate has helped me better acclimate to high-stress environments. While I was balancing school and work I was also teaching myself how to program. I enrolled myself in a self-paced computer science course with Codecademy. </p>
    <p>Taking these online programming courses I have learned three languages Python, C, and JavaScript. My favorite language would have to be Python due to the lack of syntaxes such as brackets and semicolons. As stated on the home page I am reading a book by Gayle McDowell in hopes of learning Java. Along with just learning Java, I will be learning everything to be able to ace an interview for a future tech position if I wish to do so. However, I wish to not set my aspirations in stone because I don't want to miss an opportunity that surfaces. </p>
